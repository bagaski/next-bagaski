This is a very basic blog that I have built while learning and practicing NextJS and Netlifycms. 

I am a graphic designer and creative coder - I use code while designing websites and interfaces. I also use coding as a creative tool of experimentation while designing images and sounds. In this blog I will document my proccess, findings, useful resources, etc.
