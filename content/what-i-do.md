title: What I do
---
I am a _graphic designer_, front-end developer and sound artist. I live in Berlin and work for Tactical Tech. The technologies I use are JavaSctipt, ReactJS, NextJS, D3, CSS, Tachyons, Git. I really enjoy coding and learning JavaScript. This is my first time experience of Netlify CMS and Nextjs.
